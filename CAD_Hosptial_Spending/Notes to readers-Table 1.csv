Notes to readers,,,,
Summary,,,,
This series of data tables contains information on hospital spending by type of expense for the provinces and territories from 2005–2006 to 2021–2022.,,,,
"The variables and concepts used to capture information in the Canadian MIS Database (CMDB) are based on the Standards for Management Information Systems in Canadian Health Service Organizations (MIS Standards for 2019, 2016, 2013, 2011 and 2009, and MIS Guidelines for 2006 and 2004).
",,,,
"The CMDB contains financial and statistical operations information on public hospitals and regional health authorities across Canada. Further details on the CMDB are available on CIHI’s website.

"The data in this workbook reflects total hospital activity as reported to the CMDB by ministries and departments of health. Results may change as a result of data resubmissions at later dates. Data from the CMDB is current as of March 2, 2023.

Since mechanisms for the reporting of physician compensation vary by jurisdiction, compensation of medical personnel was excluded from hospital spending to facilitate comparability of values between provinces and territories. 

Please note that the sources for the CMDB (health service organizations via their respective ministries of health) and the National Health Expenditure Database (provincial/territorial public accounts) are different. Consequently, total expenditure figures may differ slightly. 

In 2016–2017 and 2017–2018, Administrative Services expenses reported by the Northwest Territories do not include centralized services provided by the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority (NTHSSA). Territorial spending should be interpreted with caution. Established on August 1, 2016, the NTHSSA is 1 of 3 health and social services authorities in the Northwest Territories, serving the Beaufort Delta, Sahtu, Dehcho, Yellowknife and Fort Smith regions. It is responsible for the operation of the Stanton Territorial Hospital. Prior to 2016, a total of 8 regional health authorities operated in the Northwest Territories.",,,,
